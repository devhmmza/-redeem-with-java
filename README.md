Welcome to redeem-with-java, a personal journey through 50 Java projects that rise in complexity from beginner to advanced. This repository is part of my Redemption Arc â€” a mission to master software engineering, one project at a time. Each Java program here is handcrafted to reinforce core concepts such as object-oriented programming, GUI development, file handling, networking, and beyond. Whether you're a fellow learner or a curious visitor, I hope this archive inspires growth, resilience, and the power of consistent effort. Let's build the future in Java, one line of code at a time.
